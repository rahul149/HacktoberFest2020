# Dice App

# Link to the app : http://dicee-cs158.web.app



This application has been made using flutter and hosted on web with firebase because of the cross platform ability of flutter.
In this there will be two dice side by side to each other and tapping on any one of the dice will lead to change in dice image randomly. 
You can take it as a game, like getting same dice position on both dice will lead to win of the player. Or sometimes it can be used to toss in cricket match.
